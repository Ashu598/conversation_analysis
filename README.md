# conversation_analysis
We'll analyst chat transcript between 2 agents regarding articles published in the Washington post and these can be of different types of articles.


This repository contains the implementation of a data science assignment for BiztelAI. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to write production-level Python code, build APIs, and develop AI-driven solutions for real-world SaaS applications.

## **Project Overview**

The assignment involves the following tasks:

1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**:
   - Load and preprocess a dataset of chat transcripts between agents discussing Washington Post articles.
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
   - Implement object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for a modular data pipeline.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform advanced EDA to uncover patterns and insights.
   - Summarize the dataset at an article and agent level.
   - Use visualizations to analyze the data.

3. **Building a REST API**:
   - Develop a REST API using **FastAPI** or **Flask** to expose key functionalities of the processed dataset.
   - Endpoints include fetching dataset summaries, performing real-time data transformations, and providing processed insights.

4. **Implementing OOP Concepts**:
   - Use OOP to modularize data processing workflows.
   - Implement classes and methods for tasks like data loading, cleaning, and transformation.

5. **Code Optimization and Performance Tuning**:
   - Optimize Python code for efficiency using vectorized operations.
   - Improve API response time with asynchronous processing.
